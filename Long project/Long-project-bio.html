      Jason Belmonte (born 29 July 1983) is an Australian professional ten-pin
       bowler. He plays on the PBA Tour in the United States and in world
       events. He is known for being one of the first bowlers to gain media
       attention for using the two handed bowling style.
       He has won 29 PBA titles (eighth most all-time), including a record 14
       major championships. He is one of two bowlers in PBA history to have won
       the Super Slam, winning all five PBA major titles (the other being Mike
       Aulby). He has been named PBA Player of the Year six times, one short
         of the record seven awards owned by Walter Ray Williams Jr.
         Belmonte accumulated $1 million (USD) in career PBA earnings faster
         than any player in history (131 tournaments), and surpassed the $1.5
         million mark PBA earnings during the 2019 season. Belmonte has 25
         career 300 games in PBA Tour events through 2020, including the PBA's
         21st nationally televised 300 in 2012. His accolades have led many
         in the sport of bowling to refer to him as one of, if not the greatest
         bowler of all time.
