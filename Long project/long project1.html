          For a feat that has never been done, Belmote has the opportunity to be the first
          to take home 3 majors in one year, it wont be easy, but he did qualify as the number 2 seed.
          In the semi-finals he takes on Ryan Ciminelli. For the first time in his major title career, he goes into a roll off.
          Throwing a nine count, it came down to Ciminelli throwing 8 or less to move on to the finals, and he leaves a
          seven count! In the finals match, Belmonte takes on Jesper Svensson, another two hander. Svensson finished
          spare-strike to finish with 225, forcing Belmo to strike and 9 count in the tenth to make history. With the
          second shot in the tenth, Belmonte strikes, winning the match, and claiming his third major title in one year,
          cementing his place in PBA history.

          The finals match would be between Tackett and Belmonte, which has become quite the rivalry. But Tackett was
          no match for Belmo this time around. And for his 10th career major title, Belmonte wins the 2019 Tournament of Champions
          Matched only by hall of famers, Earl Anthony and Pete Webber, and it only took him 12 years, compared to Anthony's

          With yet another top seed Belmonte has a shot to take home another major title. In the finals Belmote takes
          on another powerhouse two hander in Jakob Butturff. Butturff struck in his last 6 balls, striking three times in the tenth,
          forcing Belmo to strike-spare in the tenth to become the all time leader in major titles. With his second shot
          in the 10th, Belmonte strikes, taking home the win, and not only claiming his 11th major title, but also earning

          The one major that has eluded Belmonte, the U.S. Open. Belmonte has never won the Open, but that will change
          in the 2020 Open. As the number 2 seed, he takes on Dick Allen in the semi-final match, and wins 215-187 to move on to
          the Championship match against the youngest bowler to ever win the U.S. Open, Anthony Simonsen. Both bolwers had their struggles,
          as they both had relatively low scores. Belmonte needed either a strike or a spare in the 10th to shut out Simonsen,
          and with his first ball he threw a 6 count. To no shock to anyone, he converts the spare to win his 12th major title,
          further cementing his phenominal career. This win also secured his "super slam", which is winning all five
          major titles at least once, becoming the second ever to do so.

          The PBA Players Championship was the first major of the 2022 season, and Belmonte has the opportunity to claim
          major title number 14. Belmo qualified numbeer two, to take on Arturo Quintero who qualified 3rd. In Belmo fashion
          he struck out in the tenth frame to secure the win, moving on to the championsip match agains Sean Rash.
          With a fairly slow start, Rash was behind from the begining, making it tough to come back. Coming into the tenth
          Belmonte needed a strike with his first ball to ensure the Rash couldn't shut him out. He makes a ball change
          and strikes with his first ball, and shoots 9 with his second, securing his 14th major title, his first since
            begining of Covid, extending his major title record.
